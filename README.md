# Mesh

Mesh is a JavaScript IDE that feels like a spreadsheet. 

Visualise data and edit code using similar patterns to what you'd use in a spreadsheet.

## How to install Mesh

```
$ npm install

or

$ yarn

```

Electron's install seems to be fiddly; you may need to delete the electron directory in node_modules and reinstall.

## How to start using Mesh

```
$ npm start

or

$ yarn start
```

To create a new file, just start moving the cursor around (keyboard: jkl;).

Take a look at the example in the examples directory too (keyboard: Ctrl-O).

Full shortcut information is displayed on startup.
